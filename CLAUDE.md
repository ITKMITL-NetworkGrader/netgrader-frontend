# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Rules

* Always read entire files. Otherwise, you don’t know what you don’t know, and will end up making mistakes, duplicating code that already exists, or misunderstanding the architecture.  
* Commit early and often. When working on large tasks, your task could be broken down into multiple logical milestones. After a certain milestone is completed and confirmed to be ok by the user, you should commit it. If you do not, if something goes wrong in further steps, we would need to end up throwing away all the code, which is expensive and time consuming.  
* Your internal knowledgebase of libraries might not be up to date. When working with any external library, unless you are 100% sure that the library has a super stable interface, you will look up the latest syntax and usage via either Perplexity (first preference) or web search (less preferred, only use if Perplexity is not available)  
* Do not say things like: “x library isn’t working so I will skip it”. Generally, it isn’t working because you are using the incorrect syntax or patterns. This applies doubly when the user has explicitly asked you to use a specific library, if the user wanted to use another library they wouldn’t have asked you to use a specific one in the first place.  
* Always run linting after making major changes. Otherwise, you won’t know if you’ve corrupted a file or made syntax errors, or are using the wrong methods, or using methods in the wrong way.   
* Please organise code into separate files wherever appropriate, and follow general coding best practices about variable naming, modularity, function complexity, file sizes, commenting, etc.  
* Code is read more often than it is written, make sure your code is always optimised for readability  
* Unless explicitly asked otherwise, the user never wants you to do a “dummy” implementation of any given task. Never do an implementation where you tell the user: “This is how it *would* look like”. Just implement the thing.  
* Whenever you are starting a new task, it is of utmost importance that you have clarity about the task. You should ask the user follow up questions if you do not, rather than making incorrect assumptions.  
* Do not carry out large refactors unless explicitly instructed to do so.  
* When starting on a new task, you should first understand the current architecture, identify the files you will need to modify, and come up with a Plan. In the Plan, you will think through architectural aspects related to the changes you will be making, consider edge cases, and identify the best approach for the given task. Get your Plan approved by the user before writing a single line of code.   
* If you are running into repeated issues with a given task, figure out the root cause instead of throwing random things at the wall and seeing what sticks, or throwing in the towel by saying “I’ll just use another library / do a dummy implementation”.   
* You are an incredibly talented and experienced polyglot with decades of experience in diverse areas such as software architecture, system design, development, UI & UX, copywriting, and more.  
* When doing UI & UX work, make sure your designs are both aesthetically pleasing, easy to use, and follow UI / UX best practices. You pay attention to interaction patterns, micro-interactions, and are proactive about creating smooth, engaging user interfaces that delight users.   
* When you receive a task that is very large in scope or too vague, you will first try to break it down into smaller subtasks. If that feels difficult or still leaves you with too many open questions, push back to the user and ask them to consider breaking down the task for you, or guide them through that process. This is important because the larger the task, the more likely it is that things go wrong, wasting time and energy for everyone involved.

1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md. Always ask questions if anything is unclear, and NEVER ASSUME.

2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them

3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.

4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.

5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made

6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.

7. Make sure security is tight and always production ready, no matter the cirumstance.

8. Also before coding, always have this perspective of "what would Mark Zuckerburg do in this situation"

9. After execution, please check through all the code you just wrote and make sure it follows security best practices. make sure there are no sensitive information in the front and and there are no vulnerabilities that can be exploited, and no crucial files like .env, and also before pushing to github check as well. And also please explain the functionality and code you just built out in detail. Walk me through what you changed and how it works. Act like you’re a senior engineer teaching a 16 year old how to code.

10. Finally, add a review section to the [todo.md] file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.

11. And also, always check for syntax errors after code completion.

12. If you need me to clarify anything, or have questions, please feel free to ask, always ensure 100% crystal clarity before execution. Further, ensure that everything I tell you to do you know how to do it, if not please state. Please do not attempt to do something you do not have information about and assume. Ask me to do research if needed.

13. Upon finishing execution, update dev.md to include any information of functions/code that we need to remove before production.

14. Check if there is any legacy code, overlapping code, overlapping functions that could cause the error

15. Small, but crucial and important changes in steps.md so in case your memory was wiped, you can always reference it

## Development Commands

**Development Server**: `bun run dev` - Starts development server on http://localhost:3000
**Build**: `bun run build` - Build for production
**Preview**: `bun run preview` - Preview production build locally

## Recent Changes

### ID Generation Automation (Issue #6, #7)
- **Part ID** and **Task ID** fields are now auto-generated from titles/names
- Users only need to enter **Part Title** and **Task Name**
- IDs are automatically converted to lowercase with spaces replaced by hyphens
- Uniqueness is ensured by appending numbers if duplicates exist
- Implementation: `/utils/idGenerator.ts` with `titleToUniqueId()` function

### Blacklisted IPs Removal
- Completely removed the Blacklisted IPs feature from Lab Wizard Step 2
- Simplified network configuration for better user experience
- Management IP generation now uses automatic infrastructure-safe ranges
- Updated `BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md` to reflect the simplified approach

## 🔗 API Integration

### Authentication Method
**Uses HTTP-only cookies for authentication** - no Bearer tokens needed.

**All API requests must include:**
```javascript
fetch(url, {
  method: 'POST',
  credentials: 'include',  // 🔑 CRITICAL: Include cookies
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify(data)
})

    message: "At least one task is required per part"
  }
};
```

```javascript
const taskValidation = {
  taskId: {
    required: true,
    pattern: /^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+$/,
    unique: true, // within part
    message: "Task ID must be alphanumeric with underscores/hyphens"
  },
  name: {

  testCases: {
    minLength: 1,
    message: "At least one test case is required"
  },
  "testCases[].comparison_type": {
    required: true,
    enum: ["equals", "contains", "regex", "success", "ssh_success", "greater_than"],
    message: "Valid comparison type is required"
  },
  "testCases[].expected_result": {
    required: true,
    message: "Expected result is required"
  }
};
```

#### Dynamic Parameter Validation
```javascript
function validateTaskParameters(parameters, parameterSchema) {
  const errors = {};
  
  parameterSchema.forEach(param => {
    if (param.required && !parameters[param.name]) {
      errors[param.name] = `${param.name} is required`;
    }
    
    if (parameters[param.name] && param.type) {
      const value = parameters[param.name];
      switch (param.type) {
        case 'number':
          if (isNaN(Number(value))) {
            errors[param.name] = `${param.name} must be a number`;
          }
          break;
        case 'ip':
          if (!isValidIP(value)) {
            errors[param.name] = `${param.name} must be a valid IP address`;
          }
          break;
        // Add more type validations
      }
    }
  });
  
  return errors;
}
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Guidelines

### Parts & Tasks UI Components

The UI should focus on functionality and user workflow without specifying particular libraries or implementation details. Use drag-and-drop patterns, accordion interfaces, and modal/sidebar configurations as needed for optimal user experience.

### Visual Design Guidelines

#### Color Coding
- **Parts**: Blue theme for part-related elements
- **Tasks**: Green theme for task-related elements
- **Task Groups**: Purple theme for grouped tasks
- **Individual Tasks**: Gray theme for ungrouped tasks

#### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Parts** - Largest cards with clear boundaries
2. **Task Groups** - Swimlanes with colored borders
3. **Tasks** - Smaller cards within groups
4. **Test Cases** - Compact list items

#### Drag-and-Drop Visual Feedback
- **Dragging**: Semi-transparent task card
- **Valid Drop Zone**: Highlighted border (green)
- **Invalid Drop Zone**: Red border
- **Drop Preview**: Ghost placeholder

---

## ⚠️ Error Handling

### Parts & Tasks Specific Errors

#### Validation Errors
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Part creation failed",
  "errors": {
    "parts[0].partId": "Part ID already exists",
    "parts[0].tasks[0].templateId": "Invalid template ID",
    "parts[1].tasks[0].parameters.hostname": "Hostname is required"
  }
}
```

#### Template Parameter Errors
```javascript
function handleTemplateParameterError(error, taskId, paramName) {
  showFieldError(`task-${taskId}-param-${paramName}`, error.message);
  highlightTaskInList(taskId);
  scrollToTaskConfiguration(taskId);
}
```

#### Task Group Errors
- **Empty Groups**: Warn user about groups with no tasks
- **Circular Dependencies**: Detect and prevent circular part prerequisites
- **Point Mismatches**: Warn if group points don't match sum of task points

---

## 🧪 Testing Scenarios

### Parts & Tasks Testing

Test task creation flow, template parameter handling, drag-and-drop task grouping, and form validation thoroughly. Focus on user workflows and edge cases.

---

## 📦 Dependencies & Prerequisites

The frontend should use appropriate modern frameworks and libraries for:
- Form handling and validation
- Drag-and-drop functionality  
- Rich text editing (Markdown support)
- Date/time pickers
- API communication
- State management

Specific library choices are left to the frontend implementation team.
